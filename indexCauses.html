	<h1>In April of 1939, the Nazis started working on creating a nuclear bomb during World War II. The United States found out about this and eventually started the Manhattan Project in 1942, intending to end the war for good. The Nazis scrapped their
		work on the bomb eventually. After the United States won against the Axis Powers in Europe(Nazi Germany and Italy), they still had one more enemy to win against, Japan. Japan knew there was no way they would win the war at this point, but they
		kept fighting and refused to surrender. The United States and their allies were already devastated by this war, and they all wanted a quick end to the war with no more Allied casualties. Public Opinion was in majority support for dropping of
		dropping the bomb. So on August 6th, 1945, the Atomic Bomb was dropped on Hiroshima, devastating Japan.
