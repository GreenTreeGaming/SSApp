	<h1>After the bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki, Japan surrendered from World War II because they knew they would lose, ending World War II. The United States did not tell the Soviet Union about the atomic bomb, so the Soviet Union was mad at the
		United States. The Japanese people living there struggled for decades because of the aftereffects of the bomb. The first people the Japanese Government sent to Hiroshima were not aid workers or response teams but atomic scientists to see if the
		Americans were lying or not. These effects were so harmful that even the next generation was struggling from radiation poisoning and long-time construction. 90% of all Hiroshimaall of Hiroshima and Nagasaki NursesNagasaki's Nurses, Firemen, and
		Aid Agents were killed. This was not just for the government workers; this all affected citizens. This mainly affected women because they gave birth to babies during this time. This made them go through cancer and skin diseases. Japan had
		surrendered from WW2 because they knew they would lose. This event ended WW2. The US did not tell the Soviet Union about the atomic bomb or that they would drop the bomb, so the Soviet Union got mad at the US, starting the Arms Race.</h1>
